### Who?

- I love creating visually pleasing things that also provide useful functions!

### Things I'm pretty sure [I know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
- C/C++ 🐀
- Java 🐧
- Python 🐍
- HTML, CSS ✨
- JavaScript 🛠️
- SQL 🫙
- OpenGL and GLSL 🎨

### Things I want to know

### Thing I like trying to make
- OpenGL projects (currently none are posted on GitHub though)
- Apps for school
